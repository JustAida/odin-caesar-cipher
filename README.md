# odin-caesar-cipher
This program will ask the users for the text to convert and the shift factor, then cipher it and return the modified text.

- The alphabets will wrap from "z" to "a" if the shift factor goes beyond "z".
- The alphabets will keep the same case.

If there's anything I should fix or change please let me know, any feedback is greatly appreciated.
